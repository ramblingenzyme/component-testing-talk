# What is component testing?
* Testing UI Components
* Snapshot testing
* Visual regression
* **Asserting against the DOM**

<Notes>

* Not talking about snapshot testing
    * it's a bit brittle for a UI component
    * you have to ensure the test contract on either end
* Visual regression
    * better for simple components that should be styled consistently
* Interaction testing
    * What we are talking about
    * Makes sure the interactions are consistent with mental model
    * Can test your state transitions

</Notes>

# What are we testing?
* Custom date picker field built using:
    * Atlaskit components
    * React + Hooks
* Supports setting min/max dates

<Notes>

* Atlaskit is Atlassian's UI library
* Pick a date from a calendar dropdown between optional date boundaries

</Notes>

---

# Why?
* Existing buggy implementation
* Can't use Atlaskit's

<Notes>

* Actually a rewrite of an existing component we've built
* Basically tech debt, it always took forever to get up to speed
* Got fed up of the bugs, we'd fix one bug, introduce another
* 250 line Class component handling everything at once

* Atlaskit's date picker doesn't support min/max dates out of the box
* Built using a Calendar and an Input
* Calendar is such a powerful component and Datepicker hides it's powers

# How?

* Typescript
* Storybook
* React hooks
* @testing-library/jest-dom

<Appear>
    <div>
        <p>@testing-library/react</p>
        <p>The library formerly known as react-testing-library</p>
    </div>
</Appear>

<Notes>

* Typescript
    * made sure I was using the Atlaskit components correctly
    * sped up the dev loop because I didn't have to refer to the API docs all the time
* Storybook
    * for me there wasn't a huge barrier to linking to our app and trying out configurations
        * still great to have
    * let me write a different scenarios and keep them around
    * Let me turn experimenting with the component into tests easily
    * Apologise to Philip, I'd forgotten how nice it was when talking about it last week
* React hooks
    * let me separate the concerns of the component
        * integrate them internally instead of layers of wrapping paper
    * open/close functionality
    * input validity
    * syncing input and calendar input
    * handling disabling dates and calendar state
* jest-dom
    * Jest matchers for the DOM.
    * Made assertions much more intuitive
    * Will be using in examples later on

</Notes>

# @testing-library
* Not specific to a test runner
* Wrappers for:
    * React
    * Angular
    * Vue
    * And more!

<Notes>

* Best used with Jest regardless
* Extra wrappers:
    * React Native
    * Svelte
    * Reason
    * Puppeteer
    * Cypress

# Approach

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
> &mdash; *Kent C. Dodds*

<Notes>

* This quote is at the top of testing library's Guiding Principles page
* Test with DOM nodes
* Doesn't expose component instances or methods
* Test how the user would use it

* Made sure I was testing the right things, what's rendered, not the implementation
* The connection between the implementation and the experience wasn't clear

</Notes>

```jsx
const HelloWorldSFC = (props) => <p>Hello world!</p>;

const HelloWorldFC = (props) => {
    const [displayValue] = useState("Hello world!");
    return <p>{displayValue}</p>;
}

class HelloWorldClass extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <p>Hello world!</p>;
    }
}

const components = [
    HelloWorldSFC,
    HelloWorldFC,
    HelloWorldClass
];

describe("Hello world!", () => {
    it("should render", () => {
        for (const Component of components) {
            const { getByText } = render(<Component />);
            expect(getByText("Hello world!")).toBeInTheDocument();

            // Clean up the DOM, this is usually done for us
            // between tests automatically
            cleanup()
        }
    });
});

```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>

* Each of these components look the same to the user
* The test doesn't care about the implementation.
* Majority of my tests used getByText or similar and toBeInTheDocument.

# Counter

<Counter />

<Notes>

* Play with the component
* Ask what we'd test

<Image src={coverage} size="contain" />

<Notes>

* Tweaked the coverage to only look at this component and it's dependencies
* The only test is the component test
* Coverage is not the end all be all, but by testing the UI, we've covered our hook logic too
* Finally have confidence in this component
* Tests codify the interface / experience for other people to work on

</Notes>

---

# Conclusions

* Still should only test components if needed
* Have to teach your test runner JSX

<Notes>

* Probably still the only component complicated enough for us to bother testing
* Let me see the forest for the trees

</Notes>

---

# Questions

<Notes>

* Kent C. Dodds testing trophy vs Martin Fowler's testing pyramid
    * Spend time on tests with high RoI instead of building based on difficulty to build/maintain
    * Adds static testing below Unit, meaning static analysis tools such as Typescript, Eslint

* Compared to Enzyme, I can't really say, I've only used it once before.
* But from what I do know, the focused API is great. No deep vs shallow render decision to make.

* Extra wrappers:
    * React Native
    * Svelte
    * Reason
    * Puppeteer
    * Cypress

* Queries are a
    * variant: getBy, getAllBy, queryBy, findAllBy
    * and a target: labelText, placeholderText, altText, displayValue, role, testId,
