# What?
* Custom date picker field built using:
    * Atlaskit components
    * Hooks
* Supports setting min/max dates

---

# Why?
* Have a class based component which is buggy and fixing anything always seemed to break something else.
* We would use Atlaskit's but it's limiting
* Calendar is such a powerful component and Datepicker hides it's powers

* I'll do it myself

# Testing, finally
* Want to test the feel/experience not the logic
* The expected experience is known, how we get there might change
