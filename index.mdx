# What?
* Custom date picker field built using Atlaskit components
* Use it in EAR and a few other places, for min/max date ranges
* Have a class based component with bugs, refactored to a "functional" component with hooks

# Why?
* Atlaskit's is...bad
* Calendar is such a powerful component and Datepicker hides it's powers.

* LET ME IIIN

* I'll do it myself

# Testing, finally
* Want to test the feel/experience not the logic
* the experience is stable, how we get there might change
