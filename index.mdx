# What?
* Custom date picker field built using:
    * Atlaskit components
    * React + Hooks
* Supports setting min/max dates

<Notes>

* Pick a date from a calendar dropdown between optional date boundaries
* Atlaskit is Atlassian's UI library

</Notes>

---

# Why?
* Existing buggy implementation
* Can't use Atlaskit's
* Limited API surface

<Notes>

* Actually a rewrite of an existing component we've built
* Got fed up of the bugs, we'd fix one bug, introduce another
* 250 line Class component handling everything at once
* Atlaskit's date picker doesn't support min/max dates out of the box
* Calendar is such a powerful component and Datepicker hides it's powers

# How?

* Typescript
* Storybook
* React hooks

<ul>
    <li>@testing-library/react</li>
    <Appear>
        <ul>
            <li>The library formerly known as react-testing-library</li>
        </ul>
    </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

* Typescript
    * made sure I was using the Atlaskit components correctly
    * sped up the dev loop because I didn't have to refer to the API docs all the time
* Storybook
    * for me there wasn't a huge barrier to linking to our app and trying out configurations
        * still great to have
    * let me write a different scenarios and keep them around
    * Let me turn experimenting with the component into tests easily
* React hooks
    * let me seperate the concerns of the component
        * integrate them internally instead of layers of wrapping paper
    * open/close functionality
    * input validity
    * syncing input and calendar input
    * handling disabling dates and calendar state

# @testing-library
* Not specific to a test runner
* Wrappers for:
    * React
    * Angular
    * Vue
    * And more!

<Notes>

* Best used with Jest regardless
* Extra wrappers:
    * React Native
    * Svelte
    * Reason
    * Puppeteer
    * Cypress

</Notes>

---

# @testing-library/react

* Want to test the feel/experience
* The expected experience is known, how we get there:
    * might change
    * is not always as clear

<Notes>

* Made sure I was testing the right things, what's rendered, not the implementation
* The connection between the implementation and the experience wasn't clear

</Notes>

# Approach

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

> &mdash; *Kent C. Dodds*

<Notes>

    * This quote is at the top of testing library's Guiding Principles page
    * Test with DOM nodes
    * Don't use component instances if possible
    * Test how the user would use it

</Notes>
